### Abstract
Variation in human limb dimensions and proportions is important for understanding human evolution. However, past studies focused mostly on adult patterns. Therefore, how different evolutionary forces interact with one another during growth is still unclear. This study examines how various evolutionary forces (natural selection and neutral evolution â€“ random genetic drift, mutation and gene flow) change the ontogenetic trajectories. Using a multivariate mixed effects model approach, we investigated how climatic adaptation and population structure (genetic relationships among groups) resulted from neutral evolution influenced femur and tibia dimensions in a global sample of sudadults from seven groups (n = 556). The results show that models taking into account population structure (Watanabe-Akaike information criterion (WAIC) is 10197 for best-fitting femur model and 8973 for best-fitting tibia model) are generally preferred over models without population structure (WAIC is 10301 for femur model and 9103 for tibia model). After accounting for the effects of neutral evolution, extreme temperatures have small effects on the dimensions of femur and tibia that follow the prediction of ecogeographic rules throughout growth. Mean annual temperature, however, is a poor predictor for individual bones but may explain variation in intralimb proportion among groups during growth. Each group also has its distinctive growth pattern based on model fit statistics. This study shows that adaptation by natural selection to climate has a substantial effect on growth trajectories and therefore adult morphology. This important factor should not be overlooked when interpreting postcranial skeletal morphology, even in subadults. (243/250)
