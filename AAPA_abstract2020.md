### Abstract
Variation in human limb dimensions and proportions is an important piece of evidence in understanding human evolution. However, past studies focused mostly on adult patterns and thus how different evolutionary forces interact with one another during growth is still unclear. This study seeks to understand how various evolutionary forces (natural selection and neutral evolution â€“ random genetic drift, mutation and gene flow) change the ontogenetic trajectories. Using a multivariate mixed effects model approach, we investigated how climate, lifestyle and population structure influenced femur and tibia dimensions in a global sample of sudadults from seven populations (n = 556). The results show that models taking into account population structure are preferred over models without the random effect terms. After accounting for the effects of neutral evolution, agriculturalists have longer and broader femur compared to hunter-gatherers throughout growth. Similar but somewhat different patterns exist in the tibia, in that hunter-gathers tibias are slenderer but not necessarily shorter. Industrialized populations have the shortest and slenderest femur and tibia among the three subsistence strategies compared. With regard to climate, temperature has a small but significant effect on the dimensions of femur and tibia that follows the prediction of ecogeographic rules throughout growth. Each population also has its distinctive growth pattern based on model fit statistics. This study shows that adaptation by natural selection to different lifestyles subsistence strategies has a significant effect on growth trajectories and therefore adult morphology. Climate has a relatively small effect that should not be overlooked when interpreting postcranial skeletal morphology. (249/250)
